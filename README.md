# FUTURE_DS_03 – Student Event Feedback Analysis & Dashboard Creation
This repository showcases my TASK-03 of the “Data Science & Analytics Internship” under Future Interns (India). It focuses on analyzing student event feedback data using Python and Power BI to uncover insights on student satisfaction, teaching effectiveness, and sentiment trends.

# 📇 Project Overview

    • Dataset: Student feedback dataset (student_feedback.csv → Student_Event_Feedback_Analysis.csv)
    • Tools: Python (pandas, TextBlob, VADER), Microsoft Power BI
    • Focus Areas: Sentiment Analysis, Rating Evaluation, Data Cleaning, KPI Creation, and Interactive Dashboard Design

# ╰┈➤📝 Steps Breakdown

    • Step 1: Loaded and explored raw student feedback data; verified data types, handled missing values, and ensured dataset consistency.
    • Step 2: Created new columns for overall satisfaction, satisfaction level, and sentiment scores using VADER and TextBlob NLP tools.
    • Step 3: Analyzed student satisfaction trends through average aspect ratings, sentiment classification, and satisfaction distribution.
    • Step 4: Exported the cleaned dataset (Student_Event_Feedback_Analysis.csv) and designed Power BI visualizations — including funnel, donut, area, and stacked bar charts.
    • Step 5: Developed DAX-based KPIs for overall satisfaction, sentiment ratios, and cumulative sentiment score.
    • Step 6: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing satisfaction trends, feedback sentiments, and actionable insights for improvement.

# 🎯 Outcome

Delivered a cleaned dataset and a Power BI dashboard showcasing student satisfaction levels, sentiment polarity, and aspect-based feedback insights. The project helps understand how data-driven analysis can improve course delivery and event planning.
